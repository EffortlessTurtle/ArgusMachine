# ArgusMachine
A new type of news feed. Will include 4 (at least) other projects combined. The first of these is ArgusEyes, which is the webscraper that will pull in the headline, blurb, source and date of the news. There are 3 other planned piece of this project, to be developed in a determined sequencial order.

Stay tuned for more updates in the future.
